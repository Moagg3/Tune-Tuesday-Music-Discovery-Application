Built a multiplayer Music application inspired from Cards against humanity. There is a
judge in each round, who selects a winner based on songs submitted. Application takes song inputs from Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube. It is a multiplayer game where you can play with friends from across the globe.

Used things like React Native and Firebase to implement front end and the back end.
